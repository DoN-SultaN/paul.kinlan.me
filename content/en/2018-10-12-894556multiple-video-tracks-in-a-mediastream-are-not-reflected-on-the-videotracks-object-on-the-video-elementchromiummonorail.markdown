The first issue I have found trying to [build a video editor on the
web](https://paul.kinlan.me/building-a-video-editor-on-the-web-with-the-web/). 

I have multiple video streams (desktop and web cam) and I wanted to be able to
toggle between the video streams on one video element so that I can quickly
switch between the web cam and the desktop and not break the `MediaRecorder`.

It looks like you should be able to do it via toggling the `selected` property
on the `videoTracks` object on the `<video>` element, but you can't, the array
of tracks contains only 1 element (the first video track on the MediaStream).

> What steps will reproduce the problem?
> (1) Get two MediaStreams with video tracks
> (2) Add them to a new MediaStream and attach as srcObject on a videoElement
> (3) Check the videoElement.videoTracks object and see there is only one track
> 
> Demo at https://multiple-tracks-bug.glitch.me/
> 
> What is the expected result?
> I would expect videoElement.videoTracks to have two elements.
> 
> What happens instead?
> It only has the first videoTrack that was added to the MediaStream.

Repro case.

```javascript
window.onload = () => {
  if('getDisplayMedia' in navigator) warning.style.display = 'none';

  let blobs;
  let blob;
  let rec;
  let stream;
  let webcamStream;
  let desktopStream;

  captureBtn.onclick = async () => {

       
    desktopStream = await navigator.getDisplayMedia({video:true});
    webcamStream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({video: { height: 1080, width: 1920 }, audio: true});
    
    // Always 
    let tracks = [...desktopStream.getTracks(), ... webcamStream.getTracks()]
    console.log('Tracks to add to stream', tracks);
    stream = new MediaStream(tracks);
    
    console.log('Tracks on stream', stream.getTracks());
    
    videoElement.srcObject = stream;
    
    console.log('Tracks on video element that has stream', videoElement.videoTracks)
    
    // I would expect the length to be 2 and not 1
  };

};
```
